# Critic

This is not a critic about cohesion but about how many off-topic 
practitioners are employed as real professionals and how they use generic 
nonsense instead of real/hard engineering. 

Cohesiveness is an **abstract computer science measure** unlike buzzwords
you hear from clowns like YouTubers, coaches, marketers, managers,
CRUD-API-painters, etc.

Those OOP-centric "principles" (or practices) are just mere opinion-based
workarounds for bottom programmers in an eternal war of good and bad (see
Zamasu \| DBS). We have to know how about workarounds, but do not take them
too far!.

## Taking About Clowns

Anyone can call themselves "engineer", "programmer", "executive", and this just
keeps getting crazy.

A programmer has to be skilled in *computer* programming, so most
"programmers" (CRUD API painters) are not even programmers at all but IT
labourers. An "engineer" or "executive" is traditionally someone "important"
belonging to a high "social class" according to conservative people, so
corporate also uses that as buzzwords to label their employees and so any
moron with social media is a software "engineer" now which is deplorable.

Those with no skills, even marketers who can edit video and upload it to the
internet get called engineers by capitalists because that's how they
brainwash morons to make them believe they're "important" so they have happy
(non-important) employees.

Many jobs (mostly in third-world countries) are complete garbage, but they
employ buzzwords to brainwash peons or employees (yes, capitalists see you  
from a pyramidal hierarchy, so you're a peon for them).

Even if a job is complete trash like selling cable and internet under the
sun from door to door with trash salary and no basic human rights, they now
call them "selling executives". Capitalists are currently the root of most evil,
is like Java: everything is money, everything (but the 8 primitives) is an "
object" (monolith). And guess what, money is another *generic* stereotype to
brainwash peons. Some say "capitalism has allowed great stuff", but the fact
that works doesn't mean is must be so. Slaves achieved many things long ago too.

We can have many forms of energy or value instead of money.

Some say over there: "the best slaves are those who don't know they're
slaves", or "who are happy being slaves". So have happy slaves calling them
engineers when it does not even follow any formal definition of what an
engineer is supposed to be.

I know many juniors can grow to become engineers, but a junior engineer !=
engineer (that's for another day). You have to take into account the domain
of engineering too.

The definition for engineering is clear, briefly and simple put is:
building goods for society with correctness, economical, social, legal, etc.
constraints. The key is that for **correctness** *engineering* must be derived
directly from sciences and math (even more SWE), or in my words: engineers
must be good at direct knowledge.

Thus, not everyone can be called an "engineer".

Many look down software engineers like clowns who learned to code in three
months by watching videos. We don't have anything to do with clowns.
Software engineering is powerful, is beautiful, is the engineering that
requires the most math and creativity. Others like electrical engineers
require the most physics for example. Engineering is about direct knowledge.

## Take Away

I always contrast math/FP/CS/formalism vs dev/OOP/capitalism/buzzwords and the 
result is the same:

- accurate and domain specific vs generic and general purpose.
- real engineering vs clowns who get called engineers.

Most software is cheap as I say below, so don't confuse real engineering
with daily toy development.
