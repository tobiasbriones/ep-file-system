# File System TCP Protocol

A basic file transfer protocol is designed to transfer files via TCP from a Go
server to any client.

I will work with my prior experience from these two projects I developed past
year:

- [Distributed Text File System](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/cp-unah-mm545-distributed-text-file-system):
  Real time text file system written in Java 16+, Java RMI for remote object
  invocation, and JavaFX with push, pull, and local cache capabilities, deployed
  to Linux containers on Ubuntu, one container for the file server storage and
  the other for the file registry facing the external world.

- [Dungeon MST](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/dungeon-mst): A 2D dungeon
  multiplayer video game fully written in Go employing the Gorilla Web Socket
  and ebiten as game library.
